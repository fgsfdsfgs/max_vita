## Max Payne Mobile PS Vita port

This is a wrapper/port of the Android version of Max Payne Mobile. It loads the original game binary, patches it and runs it.
It's basically as if we emulate a minimalist Android environment in which we natively run the original Android binary as is.
This is probably not entirely stable yet, so expect issues.

### How to install

Before installing the game, you should do the following on your Vita:
1. [Install kubridge](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge/releases/) same way you install other `.skprx` plugins: download `kubridge.suprx`, copy it to `ux0:/tai/` and add these lines to your `ux0:/tai/config.txt`:
```
*KERNEL
ux0:tai/kubridge.skprx
```
2. (optional) [Install fdfix](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/FdFix) if you don't want your game to crash on suspend.
2. [Extract the runtime shader compiler](https://samilops2.gitbook.io/vita-troubleshooting-guide/shader-compiler/extract-libshacccg.suprx).
3. Reboot.

You're going to need:
* `.apk` file for version 1.7 (latest version at the time of writing);
* `.obb` file for version 1.6 or 1.7 (usually located at `/sdcard/android/obb/com.rockstar.maxpayne/main.3.com.rockstar.maxpayne.obb`).

Both files [can be obtained](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11012976/how-do-i-get-the-apk-of-an-installed-app-without-root-access) from your phone if you have a copy of the game installed.
Both files can be opened or extracted with anything that can extract `.zip` files.

To install:
1. Install the latest VPK from the Releases page.
2. Extract the `assets` folder from your `.apk` to `ux0:/data` and rename it to `maxpayne`.
3. Extract `lib/armeabi-v7a/libMaxPayne.so` from your `.apk` to `ux0:/data/maxpayne`.
4. Extract the contents of the `.obb` file into `ux0:/data/maxpayne`. You can skip all the `.msf` files except for `MaxPayneSoundsv2.msf` and any extra languages that you want.
5. Extract the contents of the `data.zip` from the latest release into `ux0:/data`. Replace everything.

### Notes

You can put the game data onto `uma0:` or `imc0:` instead of `ux0:`. Paths after `:` remain the same. This document uses `ux0` in most paths as an example.

The Vita port has an extra config file, located at `ux0:/data/maxpayne/config.txt`. It is created when you first run the game and allows you to tweak some internal settings. For more detailed descriptions of said settings check the [wiki article](https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/max_vita/wiki/Config-variables).

The game will show an error message if it detects that anything is wrong. Please read those and check the relevant parts of your setup.

If the error says `Could not find symbol ...`, that likely means you have the wrong `.apk`. You need one for v1.7, others **will not work**.

If the game crashes on startup, please post an issue with your last crash dump attached.

### How to build the `master` branch

You're going to need these things recompiled with the `-mfloat-abi=softfp` compiler flag:
* The entirety of [VitaSDK](https://github.com/vitasdk) ([Linux build](https://github.com/vitasdk/buildscripts/suites/2943994805/artifacts/66184169), [Windows build](https://github.com/vitasdk/buildscripts/suites/2943994805/artifacts/66184170))
* [openal-soft](https://github.com/isage/openal-soft/tree/vita-1.19.1)
* [libmathneon](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/math-neon)
* [vitashark](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaShaRK)
* [vitaGL](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/vitaGL) (build with `SOFTFP_ABI=1 NO_DEBUG=1`)

You're also going to need the static library and header for [kubridge](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge):
```
git clone https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/kubridge.git && cd kubridge
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ..
make && make install
```

After you've obtained all the dependencies and ensured VitaSDK is properly installed and in `PATH`, build this repository using the same commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/fgsfdsfgs/max_vita.git && cd max_vita
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```
